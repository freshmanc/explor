JIT Release 20151115

Ever since DvmAsm was introduced, and DesiRun became a
separate program from DesiJIT, the facility to see the
impact on store of the various components of a program
has disappeared; that is, the r-option was ineffective.
Release 20151115 fixes this deficiency. It does so by
introducing two new DvmAsm commands, 'com' and 'stk',
as defined in the accompanying update of the DvmAsm
specification.

The substantive change in this release is the switch
to parsing block-structured DIL. The DesiJIT compiler
no longer accepts unblocked DIL. The UDC must be 
invoked with option '+B'. The B-option is no longer 
required and can be dropped as soon as convenient.
For the moment, the DesiJIT compiler takes no advantage 
of the opportunities for better code and reduced volume
of instance data afforded to it by the better structure.

It transpired that the UDC took a dislike to the
keyword 'edcl' in the revised DIL specification 
and substituted its preferred word 'edec'. As the
DesiJIT compiler is downstream from UDC, and as the
latter is as acceptable as the former, the simplest 
thing was to change the specification. See the 
attached revision of DilSpec. ;)
